	"sportdescription" : "Powerlifting is a competitive strength sport that consists of three attempts at maximal weight on three lifts:\nsquat, bench press, and deadlift. As in the sport of Olympic weightlifting, it involves the athlete attempting a maximal weight single-lift effort of a barbell loaded with weight plates. Powerlifting evolved from a sport known as 'odd lifts', which followed the same three-attempt format but used a wider variety of events, akin to strongman competition. Eventually, odd lifts became standardized to the current three.",
